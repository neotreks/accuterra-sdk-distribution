2.2 Redistributable Runtime. Solely to the extent expressly identified by NeoTreks as redistributable, Licensee may reproduce and distribute the unmodified Runtime Components as part of its compiled Application, in object code form only, to end users, provided that: (i) the Application provides substantially different functionality than the SDK and does not expose any SDK APIs for direct use by third parties; (ii) distribution is subject to an end-user license that protects NeoTreks’ interests no less than this EULA; and (iii) Licensee ensures compliance with Section 5 (Restrictions).
2.3 Seats/Scope. Usage is limited to the number of developer seats, apps, bundle IDs, environments, and/or other scope limitations specified in an Order, written agreement, or NeoTreks account portal.

3.2 Revocation. NeoTreks may revoke or suspend Credentials for security, legal, compliance, or material breach concerns, upon notice where practicable.
3.3 Security Obligations. Licensee must implement reasonable administrative, physical, and technical safeguards to protect the SDK, Credentials, and any NeoTreks confidential information against unauthorized access, use, or disclosure.

4.1 Ownership. The SDK is licensed, not sold. NeoTreks and its licensors retain all right, title, and interest in and to the SDK and Documentation, including all intellectual property rights.
4.2 Feedback. Licensee may provide ideas, suggestions, or feedback regarding the SDK (“Feedback”). NeoTreks may use Feedback without restriction or obligation, provided that NeoTreks does not publicly attribute Feedback to Licensee without consent.

5. Restrictions
Except as expressly permitted in Section 2, Licensee shall not, and shall not permit any third party to: (a) copy (except for reasonable backup), modify, adapt, translate, create derivative works of, or reverse engineer, decompile, or disassemble the SDK (except to the extent such restriction is prohibited by applicable law); (b) remove, alter, or obscure any proprietary notices; (c) use the SDK to create a competing product or service, to benchmark or publish performance tests without NeoTreks’ prior written consent, or to expose SDK APIs for third-party use; (d) distribute, resell, rent, lease, lend, host, sublicense, or otherwise make the SDK available to any third party, including via any public repository or package registry; (e) use the SDK in violation of applicable law or third-party rights; (f) circumvent or attempt to defeat any licensing, access control, security, or usage limitations in or associated with the SDK; or (g) use any component of the SDK identified as “non-redistributable” in any production Application or distribute it to end users.

6. Third-Party Components; Open Source Notices
6.1 Third-Party Software. The SDK may include or interoperate with third-party software, libraries, or services (“Third-Party Components”) governed by separate terms. To the extent Third-Party Component terms conflict with this EULA with respect to such components, those terms control for that component.

Where applicable, Licensee shall not use the SDK to collect sensitive personal data unless expressly permitted and adequately safeguarded. The SDK is not designed to process protected health information under HIPAA unless expressly agreed in writing.

8. Support; Updates
Unless otherwise agreed in writing or in an Order, NeoTreks is under no obligation to provide support, maintenance, or updates. NeoTreks may, in its discretion, make Updates available. Updates are deemed part of the SDK and subject to this EULA. Licensee is responsible for promptly installing Updates that address security or compatibility issues.

9. Fees; Taxes
If fees apply, they are as set forth in the applicable Order or NeoTreks’ price list. Fees are non-cancelable and non-refundable except as expressly stated in this EULA. All fees are exclusive of taxes. Licensee is responsible for all taxes, duties, and similar assessments (excluding taxes based on NeoTreks’ income), and will pay or reimburse NeoTreks for such amounts.

10. Confidentiality
“Confidential Information” means non-public information disclosed by one party to the other that is designated as confidential or that should reasonably be understood to be confidential, including the SDK, Credentials, roadmaps, and business information. The receiving party will use Confidential Information only as permitted under this EULA and will protect it using at least the same degree of care it uses for its own similar information, but no less than reasonable care. These obligations do not apply to information that is (a) publicly available without breach; (b) rightfully received from a third party without duty of confidentiality; (c) independently developed without use of Confidential Information; or (d) approved in writing for public release. The receiving party may disclose Confidential Information to the extent required by law, with reasonable prior notice to the disclosing party (if legally permitted).

11. Compliance; Audit
Upon reasonable prior notice, no more than once per year, and during normal business hours, NeoTreks (or its independent auditor) may audit Licensee’s records and systems reasonably necessary to verify compliance with this EULA and scope limitations. Any audit will minimize disruption and protect Licensee confidentiality. If an audit reveals underpayment or material non-compliance, Licensee will promptly pay amounts due and reasonable audit costs.

12. Term; Termination
12.1 Term. This EULA begins on the date Licensee first downloads, installs, or uses the SDK and continues until terminated.
12.2 Termination for Convenience. Either party may terminate this EULA upon thirty (30) days’ written notice if there is no then-current paid subscription or active Order.
12.3 Termination for Cause. Either party may terminate this EULA immediately upon written notice if the other party materially breaches and does not cure within thirty (30) days after notice. NeoTreks may suspend access immediately for security, legal, or compliance reasons.
12.4 Effect of Termination. Upon termination, all licenses granted to Licensee terminate and Licensee must cease all use of the SDK, delete all copies (except for one archival copy for legal compliance), and remove Runtime Components from Applications not already distributed to end users. Sections 4, 5, 6, 7 (to the extent data was processed), 9 (fees accrued), 10, 11, 12.4, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, and 18 survive termination.

NEOTREKS DOES NOT WARRANT THAT THE SDK WILL BE ERROR-FREE, SECURE, OR UNINTERRUPTED, OR THAT DEFECTS WILL BE CORRECTED.

14. Limitation of Liability
TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL NEOTREKS OR ITS LICENSORS BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, COVER, OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, OR LOSS OF PROFITS, REVENUE, GOODWILL, OR DATA, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY. NEOTREKS’ TOTAL AGGREGATE LIABILITY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THIS EULA WILL NOT EXCEED THE AMOUNTS PAID BY LICENSEE TO NEOTREKS FOR THE SDK IN THE TWELVE (12) MONTHS PRECEDING THE CLAIM. THESE LIMITATIONS APPLY REGARDLESS OF THE THEORY OF LIABILITY AND EVEN IF A REMEDY FAILS OF ITS ESSENTIAL PURPOSE.

15. Indemnification by Licensee
Licensee will defend, indemnify, and hold harmless NeoTreks and its affiliates, and their respective officers, directors, employees, and agents from and against any third-party claims, damages, liabilities, costs, and expenses (including reasonable attorneys’ fees) arising from: (a) Licensee’s Applications; (b) use of the SDK in violation of this EULA or applicable law; or (c) any data or content processed through the SDK by or on behalf of Licensee.

16. Export; Sanctions; Government Rights
16.1 Export Controls. Licensee will comply with all applicable export control and sanctions laws. The SDK may not be exported or re-exported to embargoed countries or prohibited parties.
16.2 U.S. Government Rights. The SDK is “commercial computer software” and “commercial computer software documentation.” If acquired by or on behalf of a U.S. government entity, use, duplication, and disclosure are subject to the restrictions in FAR 12.212, DFARS 227.7202, and similar regulations.

17. Publicity; Trademarks

19. Miscellaneous
This EULA is the entire agreement between the parties regarding the SDK and supersedes all prior or contemporaneous agreements on that subject. Any conflicting or additional terms in a purchase order or similar document are rejected and of no effect. This EULA may be modified only by a written agreement signed by both parties. Neither party may assign this EULA without the other party’s prior written consent, except that NeoTreks may assign to an affiliate or in connection with a merger, acquisition, or sale of assets. If any provision is held unenforceable, it will be modified to the minimum extent necessary to make it enforceable, and the remaining provisions will remain in effect. No waiver is effective unless in writing and signed.
